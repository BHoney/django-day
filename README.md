## Let's Learn Django!

This is a repo used to fiddle around with the Django back end framework, done for Sharpening day at Hawkes Learning.
This entire thing is the result of following the [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) tutorial to create a simple blog. Give them a look if you get the chance, maybe kick some funds their way, they're doing good things for those kids.

### What Was Done:
* Initial set up
* Creating Views and Templates
* Forms
* Queries and Regex


### What Wasn't
* CSS
* Actual Content Population (all place holders.)
